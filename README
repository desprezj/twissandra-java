TWISSJAVA: Twitter on Cassandra in Java.

Deps:
 + Maven: this will load our build deps.
   + Cassandra 0.6: the important thing.
   + Pelops: this is how we talk to the important thing.
   + Wicket: this is how we show other people the important thing.

Setup:
 + Install Cassandra 0.6 from http://cassandra.apache.org/ as well
    as its dependencies (Thrift). 
   + Copy the storage_conf.xml over the default configuration
 + Install Wicket with default packages and structure:
   `mvn archetype:create 
     -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.wicket 
     -DarchetypeArtifactId=wicket-archetype-quickstart 
     -DarchetypeVersion=1.4.9 
     -DgroupId=example 
     -DartifactId=twissjava`
 + Replace default files in the Wicket hierarchy with Twissjava 
    files from this checkout.
 + Include Pelops as a library from http://code.google.com/p/pelops/

Start:
 + Start bin/cassandra
 + java src/test/java/example/Start.java (starts Jetty, our appserver)
   + NOTE: Jetty uses port 8080 by default, which is used for JMX
       for Cassandra. Start.java in this checkout has it changed to 8888.
 + localhost:8888
